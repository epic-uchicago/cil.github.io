# Introduction

Change this tutorial with GitBook Editor.


1. `clone` this repository

2. Optional: download GitBook Editor

3. Install necessary packages:

```
npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install gitbook-cli -g
```

4. Make changes to anything in `pages` and in `SUMMARY.md`

5. To debug run inside the repo:

`npm install` which will install dependencies from `package.json`

(then `gitbook install` which will install plugins from `book.json`, but there are currently no any so this is not needed)

then `gulp` which will create a static website under `docs`

6. When you are happy with your edits create a pull request. Make sure to include `docs` because this is where the updated website lives. 

7. Once a green tick appears on github, the website is online!
